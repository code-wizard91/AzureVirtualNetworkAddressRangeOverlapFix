# AzureVirtualNetworkAddressRangeOverlapFix
A Script library designed to address Azure Virtual Network (VNet) IP address range overlaps. Addressing a common pain point for many companies, this repository provides tools and best practices to diagnose and remediate overlapping VNet address spaces, ensuring smooth network integrations and minimizing service disruptions.

# Why is this an issue for many companies?

Overlapping IP address ranges in Azure VNets can lead to a variety of network challenges:

Service Disruption: If two VNets have overlapping IP ranges, resources in one VNet might not be accessible from the other. This can lead to application failures or disruptions if services expect seamless communication between VNets.

VPN & Peering Complications: Overlapping IP ranges can cause issues when setting up VPN connections or VNet peering, making it impossible to establish direct communication paths.

Network Confusion: For IT and network teams, overlapping addresses can create confusion, making it hard to determine which resources belong to which VNet, especially in larger or more complex environments.

Migration Challenges: Companies transitioning resources to Azure from on-premises or other cloud providers might inadvertently introduce address overlaps if they don't carefully plan their VNet address spaces.

Security Concerns: Incorrect routing due to overlaps could potentially expose services and resources to unintended networks, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.

Given these challenges, it's essential for companies to ensure their Azure VNets have unique IP address ranges to guarantee optimal networking operations. This repository aims to address these concerns by offering tools and methodologies to detect and fix such overlaps.
